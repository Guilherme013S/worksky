# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

This project was made using node package manager (npm) as dependency manager, so the basic "npm install" and "npm start" should start a test server.

The project use latest react (27/08/2021, react 17.0.2) with functional components and hooks with typescript. The project also use modular scss for styling (there are some places where the "modular logic" is broke for convenience sake, like using the same module for more than one component) and react router (ver 5.2.0) for routes. For state management it uses the package redux toolkit (1.6.1) to work with redux (ver 4.1.1, and react-redux ver 7.2.4).

The code was barely commented, but the file structure should be obvious enough.
